		<p> India rewrote history a piece of which they had first scripted 28 years ago in June 1983. Mahendra Singh Dhoni thus joined Kapil Dev as a Cup winning captain and led from the front at the Wankhede Stadium,  Mumbai on a muggy Saturday night battling back pains and aching lets as India eased to a six wicket victory over Sri Lanka with 10 balls to spare. N Meeding 275 to win, India’s chase was anchored by Gautam Gambhir’s fighting 97 before the player of the tournament Yuvraj Singh took it home along side his captain. Fireworks blasted into the right as International Cricket Council president Sharad Pawar handed over the glittering trophy to Dhoni and his cheering teammates show were promptly showered with champagne and still more confetti. Sri Lanka had ridden a sublime unbeaten 103 from Mahela looked like the Indians had a battle on their hands with Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar back in the pavilion and only 32 runs on the board.</p>
		<p>  Earlier in Quarter final matches played during March 23 to 26. Pak. Beat West Indies in Mirpur by 10 wickets. India beat Australia in Ahemedabad by 5 wickets. New Zealand beat South Africa in Mirpur by 49 runs (3rd Qr. Final) Australia for the first time in 24 years of ICC World Cup history could not reach to cup winning stage. On March 29, in Colombo, Sri Lanka  beat New Zealand by 5 wickets in the first semi final. Brief score- N. Zealand 217 Sri Lankas 220/5. Batting first India with Sachin Tendulkar’s brilliant 35, scored 260/9 in 50 over’s but Pakistan was all out in the 50th over for 231 runs only. And India reached the final for the third time in the history of games.</p>
		<p> The World Cup victory was a fitting culmination of Team India’s steady rise over a four year period during which Dhoni led India to the T20 World title as also the numerous Uno status in ICC Test rankings.
 The 11th ICC World Cup is scheduled to be hosted by Australia/ New Zealand in 2015.</p>
